# Sentiment analysis of texts on various topics using the fine tuning technology of the BERT architecture neural network
Description of the task:
- It is necessary to create and test the sentiment analysis module (three classes: negative; neutral; positive) of the Russian-language text implemented on a static dataset.
- The data represents several datasets on various topics - fastfood (texts about fast food restaurants); prodretail (texts about grocery stores); others (texts about everything else). There are train and test sets for these domains
- The main metric is F1 for positive and negative classes.
All texts are comments from the Internet (both ordinary users and advertisements, media, etc.)

There is a baseline from iPavlov for this task, which is highly desirable to surpass
